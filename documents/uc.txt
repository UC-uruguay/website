About Me

Hi, I’m Yushi Nakashima, but everyone calls me Yūshi (ゆーし).

I live in Kōfu, Yamanashi, Japan, with my wife and my adorable son, Ichiyu (nicknamed Ichikun).

People often say I’m a bit unusual, but I love creativity and bold ideas, even if they seem unrealistic.

Family & Daily Life

A proud husband and father — I can’t stop saying how cute my wife and son are.

Enjoy spending weekends together exploring local nature, hot springs, and festivals.

Ichikun is almost 3 years old and already full of curiosity and energy.

Hobbies & Interests

Making Friends: I enjoy making new friends—it’s the most important thing in my life.

Wine & Food: I enjoy tasting and learning about wines, especially Italian and Yamanashi wines.

Time Capsule: I love burying time capsules in different parts of the world.

Creativity: Making educational games for my son, experimenting with AI-generated music, videos, and short films.

Poetry & Classics: Studying traditional Japanese things like poetry, bonsai and exploring cultural depth.

Travel & Culture

Love to travel both in Japan and abroad — I travel all 47 prefectures and around 40 countries.


Interested in Buddhist culture, temples, and unique local experiences.

Inspirations

Believe in the beauty of connecting with others through vision and empathy rather than just information.

Inspired by the idea of a “world-wide common understanding beyond religion.”
