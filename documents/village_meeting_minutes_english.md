# Meeting Minutes: Self-Sufficient Village Concept Meeting

**Date:** September 25, 2025
**Participants:** Mr. Sugihara, UC
**Agenda:** Self-sufficient village concept and idea brainstorming

## 1. Village Concept: "Modern Self-Sufficient Utopia"

Our goal is not just self-sufficiency, but a community filled with richness and joy.

### Core Philosophy:
- Modernize traditional living (like "From the Northern Country" TV series) with contemporary knowledge (YouTube etc.) and tools for efficiency
- Use time gained through efficiency for "play" and creative activities

### Economic Independence:
- Not a closed community - build a model to earn external income by sharing village-building activities on social media
- Establish a "Village Fund" with abundant resources to support villagers' dreams (overseas travel, entrepreneurship, etc.)

### Vision:
Aim for a "utopia" where everything needed for life, opportunities for challenges, and companions are all available.

## 2. Village Economic System

Lively discussions were held on how to circulate the economy within the community.

### Internal Economy (among villagers):

**Sugihara's proposal - Community currency with expiration dates:**
Introduce a system like eumo to activate economic circulation within the village.

**UC's proposal - Bartering system:**
Make bartering the foundation since currency can create ulterior motives. This creates negotiation enjoyment and fosters a community that requires honesty.

**Idea - Handmade currency:**
Analog, warm currency where we write expiration dates on paper and stamp with thumbprints could be interesting.

### External Economy (tourists and external exchanges):
- Consider issuing pseudo-currency as incentives for tourists
- Consider introducing eumo etc. for external payments. Limited participating stores create value of "seeing producers' faces"

## 3. Village Management System and Infrastructure

Building sustainable and scalable systems.

### Systemization and Horizontal Expansion:
- Package management systems to create sister villages in the future (goal: 48 villages!)
- Set up "Village Registry" and "Occupation Introduction Pages" on village website with auto-updating form input systems for easy implementation in other villages
- As villages increase, a culture like "pilgrimage" visiting village to village might emerge

### Infrastructure (achieving self-sufficiency):
**Energy:** Firewood for thermal power, utilize discarded items for electricity. Solar heat with parabolic antenna systems for hot water.

**Resources:** Reuse waste materials for toilets and renovation materials. Actively upcycle by disassembling EcoCute units to create homemade stainless tanks.

## 4. Villagers' Life and Participation Conditions

Creating systems for villagers to live safely and authentically.

### Work Style:
Promote flexible styles where various jobs can be held simultaneously within legal boundaries.

### Village Tax (proposal):
Register for basic income like OpenAI's Worldcoin, and use that income as "village tax." This eliminates actual financial burden on villagers.

### Safety Net:
Being a villager provides insurance-like function to evacuate to the village during disasters.

### Village Entry Screening:
Emphasize shared values with careful screening process:
- Interviews
- Recommendation letters from 3 trusted friends
- Friends accompanying interviews

## 5. Future Prospects

Grand plans were shared as the village's future vision:
- Expand sister villages nationwide
- Eventually collaborate/integrate (take over) municipalities at risk of disappearing to establish genuine self-sufficient villages
- Purchasing uninhabited islands (Setouchi islands accessible by boat) is also attractive
